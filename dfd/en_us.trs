&24 Namaste, and may you be having a pleasant day.

&2 Welcome very much. It is always a better day when I see you.

&26 Be very careful. I would not like to read any bad news about you on the notice board. Good day.

Wolfie is a Canine, sort of a cross between a human and a German Shepherd. He has big brown eyes.

&12 Business has been rather slow today. I am thinking that not many people have been breaking their amphorae. I make very strong amphorae, which is good for those that buy them, but bad for me that sells them.

&11 I am good and happy, for someone said today that I have made a very fine map.  Now if only that person had bought my map instead of stealing it, I would be more pleased.

&10 Things are very sunny today, and I wish I could curl up and take a nap in the sunshine. This is not very good for business, however.

&9 I am thinking that I am getting fleas. Most annoying fleas. I shall be needing to take a long bath in the sea tonight.

&8 My mouth waters at the thought of a good curry right now. I think that I must be getting hungry.

&7 Let me be thinking... It has been said that the one who had the old King killed wished to take over all of Silmaria. This is a very bad person. I do not think he would make a good king.

&5 It is said that the one who lives in the Famous Adventurer's School was once a famous adventurer. Now he seems just like a tired old man.

&4 The two who run the Apothecary are very happy.  They always act as if they had been fated to be together. This is a good thing.

&25 There is talk that you are most attractive to women.  There is one fine woman who works at the casino who thinks you would be a very good catch. Perhaps you should throw yourself at her some day.

&3 There are many people who have left Silmaria with all the bad things that have happened here. Just because we have murders in the street, a war with the Tritons, an invasion, and eventual destruction of the whole island, does not mean things are all bad.  Pickpocketing is at an all time low here, after all.

This attractive Katta lady has the beautifully expressive eyes and the sweet smile so common to her people.

&4 There is a rumor that the last king of Silmaria was murdered. It is a very sad thing, for he was a good ruler.

&8 The gentle Healer, Julanar, is with child. This is a wonderful thing, because both she and her husband are sweet people.

&13 Many people have left Silmaria because they feared the invaders. I hope that they might be able to return soon.

&14 People in this city are talking about the crime in the streets. There seem to be more pickpockets and thieves than ever before. Such is ever the way when a city has no ruler.

&15 I have heard from my sister in Shapeir that the Sultan Harun al-Rashid, may he live forever, has been blessed by his new wife with a son.

&6 My cousin, Shema, sends word to tell you that she and Shameen are well and happy, and hopes that you are the same.

&3 I am pleased, as always, to speak with you.

&7 It is a beautiful day this time of year, and I am well content, thank you.

&12 Business has been slow, for few think of romance this time of year.

&11 My day has been brightened by your presence. You are always so kind and polite.

&10 It is more damp and cool today than I am used to, but as long as the clouds do not bring rain, I am content.

&9 I have sold some jewelry today to someone who wanted to please a woman. Perhaps he will one day marry her.

This guard ignores any attempt at conversation.

This guard's face shows irritation.  It's not a pleasant expression.

&1 You may enter the Hall of Kings now.

The guard is watching you with a pugnacious look.  He definitely has a bad attitude.

Damn, I'm looking good!

You rub your hands up and down your clothes.

Talking to yourself is a sign of madness!
